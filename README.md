Small component dealing with Symbolset's js aspects.

$ bower install symbolset-js
```

## Contributing

This only deals with a small fraction of the available sets from Symbolset. If you want, fork with a new set branch and do a pull request. Awesome :)

## Compass User?

If you use compass and symbolset, I have a [neat gem](https://github.com/kuatsure/compass-symbolset) that handles the css part of Symbolset ( in sass of course ).
